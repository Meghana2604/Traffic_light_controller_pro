#  Traffic Light Controller (Verilog/SystemVerilog)

## Project Description
This project implements a Traffic Light Controller using Verilog/SystemVerilog based on a Finite State Machine (FSM).  
The controller manages traffic flow using sequential state transitions for Red, Yellow, and Green signals.

This project demonstrates RTL design, state machine implementation, and simulation verification.

---

##  Design Features
- Finite State Machine (FSM) based design
- 3-state traffic control (RED, YELLOW, GREEN)
- Synchronous design using clock and reset
- Clean modular RTL implementation
- Fully verified using a testbench

---

##  Simulation Details
- Developed and simulated using EDA Playground
- Language: SystemVerilog / Verilog
- Simulator: ModelSim / Questa / Icarus (based on configuration)
- Testbench verifies correct state transitions
